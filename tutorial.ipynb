    "\n",
    "I cannot for the life of me remember when it was or what it was but a fair few years ago I remember positioning a telescope to observe an asteroid as it silently and perhaps slightly eerily drifted between us and the Moon. I say eerily as this asteroid had the ability to cause widespread damage had it hit but of course we knew it posed no threat.  I remember at the time thinking it was mind blowing that even today, we still use mathematics with roots (pardon the pun) centuries old to calculate the position of objects in our Solar System. We get to see evidence of this again on 12th December when something rare happens!\n",
    "\n",
    "I have rather hinted to what I am referring, on 12th December, asteroid 319 Leona will pass directly in front of Betelgeuse, the red giant in the constellation of Orion whose name amusingly translates to armpit of the giant – now there’s a fact to amuse and astound your friends. To be able to calculate that a rock approximately 60 km across is going to pass directly in front of a star that is just over 650 light years away is really quite staggering.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps more excitingly if you live along a corridor from central Asia and southern Europe to Florida and Mexico then at around 01:17 UTC you have a chance – clouds permitting – to see it for yourself and you don’t need any telescope or equipment, just your eyes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Betelgeuse is the second brightest star in the constellation Orion and is a familiar favourite with its piercing red colour. It hit the news back in 2020 when it unexpectedly dimmed in the sky due to the star itself ejecting a cloud of dust. Next month it will fade for a few seconds due to the passage of Leona right in front of it. An event like this is quite rare where the light from a bright star is blocked (or occulted) by an asteroid happening every few decades at most.  It will be fascinating to watch but is also scientifically useful giving us a chance to learn more about Betelgeuse and how it’s large convection cells behave, and to learn more about the orbit and shape of the asteroid too. \n",
    "Image of Orion showing Betelgeuse upper left.\n",
    "The Constellation of Orion showing Betelgeuse at upper left (Credit : Till Credner)\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyone out there wishing to observe the event needs to be warned though, the predictions are just that, there are a few uncertainties. The size and shape of the asteroid itself is still subject to debate. Typically we tend to assume asteroids are spherical unless we know otherwise but a previous occultation of Leona in September 2023 determined that it was more of ellipsoidal in shape measuring 80km by 55km. At its distance from Earth that means it will cover an area of sky 46 x 41 milliarcseconds which is a little more than the approximate 40 milliarcseconds for Betelgeuse.  Taking this into account suggests Betelgeuse will be completely blocked from view and therefore blink out for a few seconds. \n",
    "\n",
    "Betelgeuse’s somewhat diffuse outer atmosphere may mean its apparent size is more like 50 milliarcseconds so it just fades instead.   Until the event happens we will not know exactly how it will appear in the sky or exactly when.   It’s a great opportunity to learn more about these two fascinating objets so head outside on 12th December around 01:00 UTC, wait and watch and hopefully you can witness one of natures rather more rare events. \n",

      "\n",
      "I used to develop my app solely for the Play Store, until just 2 years ago when I determined that the stress of arbitrary removals had accumulated to an unsustainable level.\n",
      "Several months later, I tentatively decided to repackage the app for F-Droid.  It wasn’t out of some matter of principle, just one of convenience; I wanted the app to ‘live’ somewhere and F-Droid was an option that had been suggested to me in the past by several users. At the time I didn’t give serious consideration to those suggestions. Now after 2 years of using F-Droid as an app developer, I can compare it against my experience with the Play Store. It’s now obvious that I should have given serious consideration to those suggestions. The developer experience has its advantages, is easier, and comes with fewer constraints.\n",
      "No ambiguity\n",
      "The main issue I faced with app removals on Google Play wasn’t so much the removals themselves; after all the Play Store needs to enforce policies. The problem was the manner in which the removals would occur, and the lack of information around it. To add insult to injury, there was a chronic inability to get a hold of someone who could explain what was going on, and in the rare cases where I did get a hold of someone, they would give no information about what or where the problem was.  The elusive agent would robotically keep linking to the same dense policy documents that the original removal email linked to.\n",
      "In almost all cases, I had to make guesses regarding the problem, re-submit, and wait for a rejection or success.  In one unique, yet bizarre incident, I received a removal email that did highlight the problem, but the sentence it pointed at was completely innocuous. Support did not help as usual. I made a guess and removed a comma from that sentence, resubmitted, and it went through.\n",
      "This is a problem with app stores in general that doesn’t affect most app developers, but when it does, only then does the one-sided nature of the relationship with the app store become apparent. My best guess is that these removals are a combination of new errant algorithms and the default assumption by app store employees that the algorithm is indisputably infallible.\n",
      "Contrast this with F-Droid: the policies are simple, documented, and in many cases codified.  For example, if a closed source library is used, which F-Droid doesn’t allow, the F-Droid build will fail, and the reason is visible in the build logs. If the app uses anti-features, the app listing page gets a warning on it indicating as much.  The important thing about something being codified and documented in a simple straightforward manner, is that it removes the stress from interactions with F-Droid.  It’s all just there.\n",
      "Reproducible builds\n",
      "F-Droid increases trust in open source code by implementing reproducible builds. Also known as deterministic builds, it’s a way of providing an independently verifiable path from source to binary code. The simple act of participating in F-Droid is enough to increase confidence in an application, if one cares about open source principles. That’s something I can appreciate.\n",
      "Comparing this with the Play Store, for any given app, no such assurance exists.\n",
      "Managed continuous deployment service\n",
      "By virtue of the reproducible builds, F-Droid is required to build the application, and it provides convenience methods to do so. The best outcome of this is that I can git tag at any point in my branch, and F-Droid picks it up, builds it, and deploys it to the F-Droid repository. F-Droid makes available the source code as well as the build logs for the application, and even provides a site to monitor the status. That’s quite useful for  troubleshooting and maintenance.\n",
      "A consequence, whether intended or unintended, is that from my perspective F-Droid effectively becomes a managed CI/CD system. The majority of my interaction ends at Github, F-Droid takes care of the rest.\n",
      "At the same time, if needed, it’s also possible to go deep into the guts of the build: even F-Droid’s build system is available to run locally.\n",
      "I don’t think there is any real comparison with the Play Store here, as there’s nothing in the way of automation there.  It’s somewhat possible, through API calls, to automate a deployment to the Play Store, but the workflow is complex and not very maintainable, or rather, considering the number of workflows, policies, and agreements that often greet the developer during the update process, it’s not meant to be maintainable.\n",
      "Reach and analytics\n",
      "While I did have a larger base of users on Google Play, there’s a liberating lack of knowledge around usage numbers or reviews on F-Droid. Shortly after the move from Google Play, the act of deploying to F-Droid felt like it was being released into the void, but over time it’s just something I’ve gotten used to. The only indications I have of usage are adjacent and incidental; although I’ve still not returned to former levels of involvement with the app, there is still a healthy amount of conversation and issues over Github and emails.\n",
      "Closing thoughts\n",
      "It’s true that the Play Store does come with various conveniences and additional analytics around deployments, errors, and installations.  Its position as the default app store on devices gives it a larger user base.  All of these are not available on F-Droid for good reasons, which I’m willing to give up on for the benefits that deveoping for F-Droid provides.\n",

THE FLY\\nLondon is the world’s busiest airline market when counting all six of its area airports. During the 12 months to June, according to Cirium Diio data, airlines scheduled almost 97m seats from Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted, Luton, City, and Southend airports. New York’s three major airports, by comparison, offered just 86m seats. In calendar year 2019, for the record, London’s airports offered 109m seats.\\nWhat are the key overseas markets for London? Many of London’s flights connect the city with markets across Europe. Diio shows Dublin and Amsterdam to be London’s busiest routes. But the UK capital is a giant market for overseas travel too. Below is a ranking of London’s top routes by available seat miles (ASMs), which factors in distance.\\xa0\\nDubai ranks number one, just ahead of New York JFK. If you combined JFK and Newark though, the New York market comes out ahead. Looming large on this list are cities once part of the old British empire, including Dubai and New York but also Singapore, Delhi, Hong Kong, etc.\\n\\n\\n\\nNever miss an on the fly story.

from Spain’s giant airline market.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy Mike Malik, Chief Marketing Officer at Cirium\\nIf you’re an airline based in Spain, or flies to Spain, this is your favorite time of year. It’s the summer peak tourist season! In July alone, airlines are scheduled to operate more than 94,000 flights to and from Spanish airports, offering more than 16m seats.\\n\\n\\n\\nThose figures are from Cirium Diio, our industry-leading airline analytics system. Across the whole world, only five other countries (the U.S., China, India, the U.K., and Japan) will have more airline seat capacity than Spain this summer.\\n\\nThe Spanish market is now largely back to where it was pre-pandemic in terms of capacity. For the upcoming July-to-September quarter, total scheduled flights from Spanish airports are down 1% from the same quarter in 2019. \\n\\nSeat capacity, however, is up 1%. Comparing this summer to last year, flights and seats are up about 7% and 8%, respectively.\\n\\n\\nTrends vary by market. Barcelona, which hosts this year’s Airports Council International Annual General Assembly, is the least recovered of Spain’s major markets, with third quarter seat capacity still down by double digits from pre-pandemic levels. As an analysis of Cirium Diio data makes clear, this decline is due to several factors, including capacity cuts by low-cost carriers like EasyJet, the bankruptcy of Norwegian Air, and the loss of air service from Russia. Some airlines are growing in Barcelona, however, including Ryanair and Volotea.\\n\\n\\n\\nMadrid, Spain’s capital city and largest airline market, is also less busy today than it was in 2019. Madrid is another place where EasyJet has cut a lot of capacity. \\n\\nIberia also has fewer seats from Madrid, in part because it’s flying less capacity on the Madrid-Barcelona route. Its seat capacity is up slightly though, if you include Iberia Express, its low-cost affiliate.\\nMany of Spain’s popular beach markets, by contrast, are busier today than they were before the pandemic. This is true of Palma, Malaga, Ibiza, and the Canary Islands. These are markets mostly unaffected by the decline in business traffic that many airlines have seen since the pandemic.\\n\\n\\n\\nOne unique feature about Spain’s airline market is its ties to Latin America. Diio shows scheduled flights from Spain to 27 different Latin American airports. Madrid-Bogotá is the busiest of these routes, served by Iberia, Air Europa, Plus Ultra, and Columbia’s Avianca. Avianca flies from Bogotá to Barcelona as well. \\n\\n\\nThe Spain-to-Latin America market is a top priority for IAG, the owner of Iberia. IAG has a contract to buy Air Europa if regulators allow. Vueling, which operates mostly within Europe, is part of IAG too. So is Level, a longhaul low-cost carrier from Barcelona flying to a few cities in North and South America.\\n\\nThe skies over the North Atlantic will be busy from Spain this summer. Diio shows flights to 16 different airports in the U.S. and Canada. Airlines will fly from Spain to 26 different airports in Africa, many in nearby North Africa, and another 10 in the Middle East. The Spain-to-Far East Asia market is rather small, with nonstops to just Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Seoul, Singapore, Hangzhou, and Chongqing. Surprisingly, there are currently no nonstop flights from Spain to India.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat’s also surprising is that Iberia is not Spain’s largest airline, at least measured by seats this quarter. The country’s largest airline is Ryanair, offering more than twice as many seats!\\n\\n\\nWhich new airlines will come to Spain? Where will Spanish airlines like Iberia, Vueling, and Air Europa fly next? Cirium will be keeping current on all the latest data!\\nIn conclusion, it is worth emphasizing that Spain’s airlines have demonstrated exceptional operational performance. Iberia, Air Europa, Iberia Express, and Vueling Airlines stood out in 2022, with Iberia earning the prestigious accolade for Europe’s most on-time airline.

recovery\\nJune 30, 2023\\nChinese airlines are recovering slowly from the effects of the pandemic, but they are still set to dominate the global aerospace market for the next decade.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy Asia Finance Dashboard Editor, Vanessa Gu\\nRegister to download the full presentation document.\\n\\nChina’s flight capacity returned to 2019 levels in January, with growth expected to continue and surpass pre-pandemic levels by 30% by the end of the third quarter.\\n\\n\\n\\nHowever, this is overwhelmingly being driven by domestic travel, while the rebound in international flights remains subdued, according to data presented by Rob Morris, global head of consultancy at Cirium Ascend Consultancy during a Bloomberg Intelligence webinar on China’s aviation recovery on 27 June.\\n“There are issues with aircraft availability, but there are also issues with geopolitics, route rights, politics itself and inter-country relations if you like, and confidence issues,” says Morris.\\nSlow international recovery\\nCompared to pre-pandemic levels, China’s international ASKs in June were down more than 50%, Cirium Diio schedules data shows.\\n\\n\\n\\nSource: Cirium Schedules\\nOn average, China’s international capacity remains 48% down year-on-year in September 2023. US flights, which accounted for 16% of China’s international capacity in September 2019, are down more than 80% in September this year, due to route rights and geopolitical issues, says Morris.\\n\\n\\n\\nSource: Cirium Schedules Data, 22 June 2023, brackets indicate total share of September 2019 China International Capacity\\nUnder-utilized fleet\\nGlobally, aircraft utilisation is also back to where it was in 2019, but that is not the case for China across both single- and twin-aisle fleets, which represents a “significant opportunity to further leverage existing aircraft and generate more capacity in the network,” says Morris.\\n\\nCirium aircraft tracking data shows that China’s twin-aisle aircraft are averaging utilization of 7.5 hours per day, well short of the average of around 12.5 hours a day.\\n\\n Single-aisle utilization is also lower at close to eight hours a day compared, compared to an average of around nine hours.\\n\\n\\n\\nSource: Cirium aircraft tracking data \\nThe lower twin-aisle utilization is a “clear indication” that wide-body aircraft are flying largely on the domestic network,” says Morris, and it needs to see “effectively more single-aisle or indeed other twin-aisle aircraft, entering the fleet to be able to release the capacity being used in the widebody side and the domestic market to enable the international growth.”\\nDespite those near-term challenges, China will “significantly outpace global capacity growth in the next 10 years,” says Morris, adding that the growth is expected to be 1.6 times that of global growth.\\nThis will drive an expected doubling of China’s fleet, requiring around 3,800 new aircraft over the next decade.\\nChina’s airlines today have only 750 new aircraft in firm order backlog, which indicates that they may have “under ordered effectively” based on the expected demand, says Morris.\\nC919 on the ascendancy?\\nAs China looks to double its fleet, the Comac C919 is expected to play a significant role in the future growth plans of the country’s airlines.\\nOf the new fleet required, Cirium Ascend expects that 500 C919s will enter service in the next decade, making up 15-20% of new deliveries.\\nWhile significant, this is still below the 1,500 deliveries expected by Airbus and 800 from Boeing, says Morris.\\nTo date, there is only one C919 in commercial service with\\xa0China Eastern, having operated its inaugural service between Shanghai and on 28 May carrying 128 passengers.\\nBy the end of this year, Comac is expected to deliver eight more C919s, based on Cirium fleets data. With Airbus and Boeing facing supply chain issues, there is an opportunity for Comac to gain market share, provided they can “execute right here, right now,” says Morris, adding that it will be a challenge to execute better than “established OEMs.”\\nHe notes that the Airbus and Boeing narrowbody fleet in China has enjoyed dispatch reliability of over 99%, and airlines will be looking for the C919 to attain a similar level.\\n\\nThe C919 will have to deliver that kind of dispatch reliability of eight-to-nine-hours-per-day-type utilization to be an effective competitor in that market. \\nRob Morris\\nWith China’s aviation sector, there definitely is opportunity for growth, but there are also significant risks and headwinds. As it emerges from a post-covid world, it may not be business as usual as the world knows it.\\nRegister to download the full presentation document.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSummer In Spain \\n\\n\\n\\non the fly:\\xa0What are the leading airline growth markets for Q3?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBack to Thought Cloud\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ntwitter\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nlinkedin\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nweixin\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nyoutube\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSolutions\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSchedules and routes data\\nDiio Mi\\nFleets and valuations data\\nSustainability solutions\\nAircraft Fleets Analyzer\\nValues Analyzer\\nTraveler Services\\nCirium Sky\\nFlightStats\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tConsulting Services\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAscend Consultancy\\nPro data services\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAviation Data\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAviation Data Sets\\nCustom data services\\nData quality\\nData supply and partnerships\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIndustries\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAviation finance\\nAerospace\\nAirlines\\nAirports\\nANSP\\nUTM providers\\nCorporate travel\\nGovernments\\nTraveler services\\nISVs / software developers\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAviation Resources\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThought Cloud\\nAviation events and webinars\\nOn-time performance\\nResearch and reports\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAbout Cirium\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAbout\\nCareers\\nContact us\\nSubscribe\\nLeadership\\nRELX\\nCirium Japan  日本\\nCirium Korea 한국\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tCirium® is a brand of LexisNexis® Risk Solutions, part of RELX.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDisclaimer\\nTerms and conditions\\nPrivacy policy\\nCookie settings | your privacy settings\\nCookies\\nFair processing notice\\nSecurity\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nCopyright © 2023 LexisNexis Risk Solutions\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\", metadata={'source': 'https://www.cirium.com/thoughtcloud/analysis-china-slower-post-pandemic-aviation-recovery/', 'title': 'Analysis: China’s slower road to post-pandemic aviation recovery – Cirium', 'description': 'Chinese airlines are recovering slowly from the effects of the pandemic, but they are still set to dominate the global aerospace market.', 'language': 'en-US'})]"

Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \\n\\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \\n\\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \\n\\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \\n\\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \\n\\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \\n\\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \\n\\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \\n\\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \\n\\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.\\nSource: 0-pl\\nContent: And we won’t stop. \\n\\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \\n\\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \\n\\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \\n\\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \\n\\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \\n\\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \\n\\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \\n\\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \\n\\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \\n\\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.\\nSource: 24-pl\\nContent: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \\n\\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \\n\\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \\n\\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \\n\\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \\n\\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \\n\\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.\\nSource: 5-pl\\nContent: More support for patients and families. \\n\\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \\n\\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \\n\\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \\n\\nA unity agenda for the nation. \\n\\nWe can do this. \\n\\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \\n\\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \\n\\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \\n\\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \\n\\nNow is the hour. \\n\\nOur moment of responsibility. \\n\\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \\n\\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \\n\\nWell I know this nation.\\nSource: 34-pl\\n=========\\nFINAL ANSWER: The president did not mention Michael Jackson.\\nSOURCES:\\n\\nQUESTION: {question}\\n=========\\n{summaries}\\n=========\\nFINAL ANSWER:'"
